This is a tree-like directory containing one *project_name/experiment_name* folder for each experiment under different projects. Each project folder can have multiple experiment folder. 

Within each *project_name/experiment_name* folder, there are three subfolders: *notebooks*(code for project and experiment-specific analysis), *data* (data for project and experiment-specific analysis), and *results* (analysis results). The *data* and *results* folders will be automatically created by Part_1.ipnb in the *notebooks* folder. 

Before each analysis, please create a *project_name/experiment_name* folder here. Next, copy the *notebooks* folder from the top level of the repo into the *project_name/experiment_name* folder.
